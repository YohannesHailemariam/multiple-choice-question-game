The fake authentication enables them to access the protected route which is the McqPage where the multiple question game will be played.
In the McqPage where the game play will be held, there are some features to discuss about. The game has 10 questions and after a user fills all the questions and clicks the submit button, this action will take the user to a section where the user's result out of ten will be displayed. The next and previous buttons are there to prevail the next and the previous questions. If the user is not interested in playing the game anymore there is a logout button to take him back to the login page.
